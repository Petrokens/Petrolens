"Are the technical specification document covers the relevant specifications for all items required as per the scope of the tender and as listed in the schedule of items?","Yes",0.9,"The design basis extract provides a detailed list of requirements and obliged codes & standards for the civil design work and technical specification of the BLEP project. It covers the range of design loads, design criteria, specific requirements, architectural requirements and other aspects of the project, although full visibility into the entire schedule of items or complete tender scope is not provided in the extract."
"Are the quantities indicated for the items in the schedule of quantities computed correctly covering the entire scope of work?","No",1,"The design basis extract does not provide a schedule of quantities or related calculations."
"Whether the item/description indicated clearly and unambiguously the scope of supply and the work involved?","Yes",0.85,"The scope of the project and the work involved are clearly detailed. Particularly in the 'SCOPE' section, where it is mentioned that the document provides a basis for detailed civil and structural design works for various elements of the Borholla Life Extension Project (BLEP) – Jorhat Asset. However, more details about the scope of the supply could have been provided to better understand material and equipment requirements."
"Are free issue items in the contract clearly","No",0.99,"There is no clear mention or section in the design basis extract regarding any free issue items in the contract."
"Whether the document is prepared as per the guidelines in Tender Specification?","Yes",0.95,"The design basis document specifies and adheres to the IS codes and standards for civil/structural design, as generally required in tender specifications. However, the specific guidelines of a tender specification is not directly mentioned, which might be needed for a fully accurate assessment."
"Are the values of parameters listed, correct?","No",0.9,"The design basis extract does not provide specific values for the parameters. Details such as load calculations, material properties, dimensions, geographical and meteorological parameters etc. would need to be provided and checked against real values for comparison."
"Are the list of codes (Latest or as per Specification) to be followed completely?","No",0.85,"The design basis extract mentions that the design will be carried out in accordance with the latest IS Codes and Standards. However, it does not list down the specific IS Codes that will be followed. The list of codes is essential to understand the basis of design and ensure compliance."
"Are the Load Combination for both Civil/Structural are listed Completely?","No",0.75,"The document mentions a section for 'Load Combinations' under 'Design Load and Its Combinations' but does not provide the details in the provided extract. Full verification cannot be performed."
"Are all-Basic Load definition/parameters are covered?","Yes",0.95,"The design basis provides clear definition and parameters for multiple load types such as dead load, imposed load, dynamic load, impact load, wind load, earthquake/seismic load, equipment/vessel load, piping load, temperature load, earth pressure, hydrostatic load, surcharge load, traffic load and other loads. The load combinations are also mentioned, indicating thorough coverage of basic load definition and parameters."
"Are the Wind Load definition/parameters are covered Correctly?","No",0.98,"The provided design basis extract lists 'Wind Load' in its table of contents but does not provide any details or parameters for it in the provided extract. Full verification would require the full document."
"Are the Seismic Load definition/parameters are covered Correctly?","No",0.6,"The design basis extract mentions earthquake/seismic load in the table of content but the definition or parameters for seismic load are not indicated or described in the provided extract."
"Are the Min and Max values of Concrete (Clear Cover, min cement contents etc.) and Structure (Min thickness etc.) values are given as per code or Tender Specification.","Yes",0.8,"The document mentions guidelines for material specification for concrete and the minimum cover for reinforcement. It also specifies the minimum thickness of structural concrete elements. However, the detailed information regarding mix and max values is not available in the provided extract. For a comprehensive evaluation, the full design basis report should be thoroughly reviewed."
"Are the Grade of Concrete for RCC and PCC work are Specified as per Code or Tender Specification?","No",0.99,"The grade of concrete for RCC and PCC work is not specifically mentioned in the provided document extract."
"Are the Factor of safety for overturning/Sliding/Uplift are covered Correctly?","No",1,"The design basis document does not mention about Factor of Safety against overturning, sliding, or uplift."
"Are the Grade of Steel for Main Reinforcement and Secondary Reinforcement are Specified as per Code or Tender Specification?","No",0.95,"The provided extract does not contain specific information on the Grades of Steel for Main Reinforcement and Secondary Reinforcement as per Code or Tender Specification. Further details may be provided in other sections of the document that are not included in this extract."
"Are the Grade of Structural Steel are Specified as per Code or Tender Specification?","No",1,"The extract does not provide information about the grade of structural steel"
"Are the Design Philosophy for Main Important Structures are covered?","Yes",1,"The document covers design philosophies of key structures with sections dedicated to various structures like control room, substation building, roads, storm water drain, culverts and road crossings, pipe racks etc. in point 8."
"Are the Design Parameter (Bearing Capacity, Water Table, Pile Capacity, Pile length etc.) required to design the foundation are covered as per soil Report?","No",0.95,"The design basis extract does not mention or provide any information regarding specific foundation design parameters such as Bearing Capacity, Water Table, Pile Capacity and Pile Length."
